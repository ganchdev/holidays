# The CalendarGeneratorService generates a calendar structure for a property's bookings
# organized by weeks and days for a specified year.
#
# This service:
# * Fetches all bookings for a property within the specified year
# * Groups them by date
# * Constructs a weekly calendar structure with associated bookings
#
# @example
#   calendar = CalendarGeneratorService.new(property: my_property, year: 2023).call
#   calendar.each do |week|
#     puts "Week starting: #{week[:start_date]}"
#     week[:days].each do |date, bookings|
#       puts "  #{date}: #{bookings.count} bookings"
#     end
